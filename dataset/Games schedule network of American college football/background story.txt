This case describes the games schedule network of American college football in the 2000 season. Nodes represent college teams. Edges represent regular season games between the two teams.
The teams are divided into several conferences. Each conference contains around 8 to 12 teams. Games are more frequent between members of the same conference than between members of different conferences, with teams playing an average of about 7 intra-conference games and 4 inter-conference games. Inter-conference play is not uniformly distributed. Teams that are geographically close to one another but belong to different conferences are more likely to play one another than teams separated by large geographic distances.
